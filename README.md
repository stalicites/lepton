# Lepton
Lepton is a (current in progress) social networking platform. It is developed primarily as an alternative to Photop (very bad).
Some key differences:
- Very edgy name
- It is written in TypeScript with React = Less Bugs
- It is open source = secure
- It will have more features
- Customizable appearance
- Developer friendly, easy to use API for bots (and services)
- Its design mitigates conflict for attention and unnecessary spam.
- Mobile friendly
